          "Are there any cultural nuances or references you want highlighted?"
          "Can you share the specific social media post in text format?"
  
          2. Local Slang and Idiom Explanation with Cultural Equivalents

          "What is the slang or idiom you need explained?"

          "Do you want to hear explanation include historical or cultural context?  (optional)"
  
          3. AI-Powered Personal Culture Learning Pathway and Event Recommendations

          "Are you interested in Nepalese culture, Hong Kong culture, or both?"

          "Would you prefer recommendations for activities, reading materials, or events?"
